- Implement functionality to list, upload, and download files from specified buckets.

- Ensure the service can handle different file types and sizes efficiently.

- Incorporate error handling for connectivity issues and access permissions.


Milestone 2: Configurable Interface Implementation

- **Requirements:**

- Create a user-friendly interface allowing users to specify source and destination buckets.

- Implement input validation to ensure correct bucket names and file paths.

- Provide feedback to users on the status of file transfers (e.g., in progress, completed, failed).

- Design the interface for scalability, allowing for future addition of features.


Milestone 3: Admin Panel for Credential Management

- **Requirements:**

- Develop a secure admin panel for managing AWS credentials.
